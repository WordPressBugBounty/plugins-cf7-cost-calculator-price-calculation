== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Some antivirus programs or website security plugins may mistakenly flag our plugin as a potential threat because it contains certain functions or code patterns — such as eval() or dynamic code execution — that are sometimes associated with malicious scripts.

However, in our case, these features are used for legitimate technical purposes, such as performing advanced calculations or supporting dynamic features within the plugin.
We want to emphasize that our plugin is completely clean, safe, and has been thoroughly tested.
These warnings are false positives, caused by general scanning rules that sometimes misinterpret advanced code structures as suspicious.
